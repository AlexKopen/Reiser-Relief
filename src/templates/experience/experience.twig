            Mission trips allow us to connect with Haitians, our teammates and with God, learn about the needs of the
            poor, and transform our hearts. During and after a mission trip, God will lead you on a path to respond to
            the needs of others. Your heart will never be the same.

                                Our focus in Haiti is on connecting, learning, transforming and responding. We will go
                                places where you will have the opportunity to connect with Haitians and learn about
                                their culture and lives. We spend time at schools, orphanages, homes for elderly, and
                                hospitals, and look for opportunities to learn from the Haitians while sharing our time
                                and talents in ways that are respectful and meaningful.

                                Mission work can help you separate from your everyday world, connect to yourself, God
                                and others, learn and transform your heart and priorities. We will spend time together
                                as a group each evening reflecting and sharing. Most importantly, we look for
                                opportunities to share Christâ€™s good news by being His hands and feet in serving those
                                He puts in front of us.
