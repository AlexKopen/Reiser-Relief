            Mission trips allow us to connect with Haitians, our teammates and with God, learn about the needs of the poor, and transform our hearts.  During and after a mission trip, God will lead you on a path to respond to the needs of others.  Your heart will never be the same.

                        Our focus in Haiti is on connecting, learning, transforming and responding.  We will go places where you will have the opportunity to connect with Haitians and learn about their culture and lives.  We spend time at schools, orphanages, homes for elderly, and hospitals, and look for opportunities to learn from the Haitians while sharing our time and talents in ways that are respectful and meaningful.
                        Mission work can help you separate from your everyday world, connect to yourself, God and others, learn and transform your heart and priorities.  We will spend time together as a group each evening reflecting and sharing.
                        Most importantly, we look for opportunities to share Christ’s good news by being His hands and feet in serving those He puts in front of us.

                    We encourage team members to include friends and family in their mission by asking for prayer or financial support. Your team leader can provide a support letter template and give ideas on how to get your community involved in your mission.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A Catholic priest, Fr. Bernard Reiser, founded Reiser Relief.  We are a Catholic based organization, but we welcome all Christian believers and non-believers to join in our ministry.  While we will pray together on trips, participation is optional and we respect your boundaries.
                    Expect to be spiritually challenged on this trip.   “Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those to love him?” James 2:5

                <p>
                    Pray and examine your heart.  Prepare to humble yourself.  Haitians will teach you a great deal.
                    Are you flexible?  Are you willing to be uncomfortable, challenged and overwhelmed?
                    If you have an open heart God will work through you.

                    We encourage you to discuss physical limitations with your potential trip leader. If God has put this on your heart and we feel confident that you can travel safely, we will find a way to accommodate special needs.

                <p>
                    Creole and French are the two official languages.  Our teams always have Haitian interpreters with them in the field.  It’s helpful to learn basic Creole phrases before your trip.

                    Yes, but not unbearable!  The average daily high in January is 87 degrees F and in July is 92 degrees F.  Rainy months are April, May, August, September and October.  There is air conditioning in the bedrooms and fans throughout the house.  You will sweat.

                <p>
                    Overall Haitians are friendly and peaceful people.  However, there are risks associated with any international travel.  Team members in Haiti are required to follow strict rules to minimize risk and we take every precaution possible to keep you safe.
                    The guesthouse where we sleep has a high security wall topped with barbed wire and 24 hour security.

                <p>
                    We will ride in a “tap tap.” This Haitian version of a bus allows for open air viewing of the city and sites while we travel. Many roads in Haiti are extremely rough and you will be bounced around.

                <p>
                    We stay in one of the guesthouses operated by Healing Haiti in Port Au Prince, 15 minutes from the airport.  The houses have air-conditioned bedrooms and bathrooms with showers and flushing toilets. The bedrooms have bunk beds, pillows and blankets. We eat family style in a dining room. A 6-foot security wall surrounds the houses.

                    Haitian staff at the guesthouse prepares breakfast and dinner. We will eat mostly American style food (like pancakes, French toast, tacos and spaghetti) and some traditional Haitian food including rice and beans, plantain and vegetables.

                    Team members buy snacks in the US and carry them to Haiti in our luggage.  We eat snacks while on the go for lunch and share all of our food.  Typical items are beef sticks, granola bars, nuts, dried fruit, and crackers.  Please don’t bring anything containing chocolate.  It will melt!
                    If you have special dietary needs you are welcome to bring your own food.  Haitian staff members cook our meals in the kitchen. You are welcome to prepare your own food in the kitchen.

                <p>
                    Yes! We will shop at least once during our mission trip. Haitians create many beautiful souvenirs they are eager to sell. Bartering is customary and should be used for purchases bought on the street. There are also goods for sale at the airport.
