                Education provides hope and opportunity for the future of Haiti. Because there are few public
                schools in the country, the only opportunity that most children have for education is through
                private schools. With an average monthly income of $50 USD, most families cannot afford to
                send their children to school.
            </p>
            <p>
                We support four schools that together educate over 1,100 students. One of these schools is Terre
                Promise School located in Cite Soleil, a slum known to be the poorest and most dangerous area
                in the Western Hemisphere. Over 400 students are enrolled in elementary and high school at
                Terre Promise. In 2019, we began partnering with Sister Paesie, foundress of The Kizito Family,
                to construct Saint Michael School in a different area of Cite Soleil. We have built a security wall,
                water tank, and latrines. The school building is scheduled to be completed in 2020. This school
                will be a haven for street children who otherwise would not have the opportunity to receive an
                education.

                Reiser Heights School, located in the rural village of Donte, educates 314 students in
                kindergarten through ninth grade. We pay teacher salaries at Reiser Heights to ensure that school
                fees are affordable for poor families. We also sponsor a lunch program at Guardian Angels
                School in Leogane, where locally sourced food provides nutritious meals to over 250 students.
                Recently, we paid for the construction of a new cafeteria and sport court at Guardian Angels.
                This school is run by the Companions of Jesus sisters.
            </p>

                In 2015, Cecelia Duffy Memorial School was constructed in Marfranc, an isolated community in
                southwest Haiti. This school educates 172 children in kindergarten through third grade. We will
                expand Cecelia Duffy Memorial School with a second building in 2020. This school is operated
                by the Little Sisters of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus.

                Our university program equips young men and women with the education and skills they need to
                provide for themselves, their future families, and become leaders within their communities. Our
                scholarship recipients are studying medicine, business, agriculture, and computer science at the
                best universities in Port au Prince.

                A severe lack of public social services in Haiti leaves the elderly and disabled extremely
                vulnerable.

            <p>
                <a href="/about/our-founder" class="plain-link">Fr. Bernard Reiser’s</a> first project in Haiti was to construct Village of Jesus, a home for
                abandoned elderly women in Leogane. There are currently 40 women lovingly cared for here by
                Companions of Jesus sisters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same Haitian sisters manage another home for orphaned elderly women in Port au Prince.
                With your support, we renovated Sacred Heart Elderly Home. These renovations greatly
                improved overall accessibility and comfort for the residents. The remodeled kitchen allows large
                meals to be easily cooked by the staff, and a new outside patio gives elderly residents a safe
                place to enjoy the outdoors. We also constructed a security wall for the property and renovated
                the sister’s residence on the second floor of the building. Ongoing financial support provides
                locally sourced food and medical care for the 25 women at Sacred Heart.

                In 2015, Reiser Relief began partnering with the Little Sisters of St. Therese of the Child Jesus in
                Marfranc. We rebuilt two eldercare facilities in the aftermath of the devastation caused by
                Hurricane Matthew. We continue to provide food and medical care to 32 elderly men and women
                cared for at these homes by the sisters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reiser Relief supports a home for disabled persons in Port au Prince, which is operated by
                religious brothers of the Missionaries of the Poor. We aide the missionaries in their care for
                severely disabled children and adults by assisting with facility improvements. These beloved
                children of God would have no hope for survival without the presence of the brothers who care
                for them with unconditional love.

                Haitians are hard-working and industrious people. Having the ability to make a living boosts
                self-esteem, gives a sense of purpose, and contributes to a happy society. Our ministry benefits
                the Haitian economy by creating jobs, sourcing materials locally, and partnering with
                organizations who share this philosophy. We work with community leaders where our projects
                are located to determine the needs of the areas we serve. Our ministry promotes Haitian business
                by hiring local companies for our construction projects and purchasing material from local
                vendors. We provide long-term, stable jobs at our schools and elder homes. In addition to this,
                our university program equips young adults with the skills they need to get hired in the future or
                start their own small businesses.

                Haiti is a lush country capable of once again becoming self-sustainable through agriculture. A
                wide range of fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, banana, mango, avocado, tomatoes,
                cassava, and yams grow abundantly in the country. In addition, Haitians grow a variety of beans,
                rice, and grains including corn and sorghum. Cash crops include coffee and cacao. Livestock
                such as chicken, goats, and pigs provide eggs, milk, and meat.
            </p>
            <p>
                We support the Haitian economy by purchasing locally produced food in collaboration with our
                partner ministries. This food is used to feed children at our schools and homes for the elderly.
                This practice protects the livelihood of small family farms and ensures nutritious, balanced meals
                for our students and residents. We also organize seed and livestock (goats, pigs, and cows)
                distributions for poor families who live in the areas where our rural ministries are located.

                Since 2005, we have collaborated with our ministry partners to provide clean water free of
                charge to residents of Cite Soleil, the poorest slum in the Western Hemisphere. Residents of this
                slum have no toilets and no running water. Without clean water, children contract parasites and
                bacteria and die from disease and malnutrition. Fresh water, trucked in and distributed bucket by
                bucket, sustains thousands of families six days a week, 52 weeks a year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reiser Relief promotes sustainable water solutions for our ministry partners. In Marfranc, we
                purchased a generator and pump that provide clean water for our primary school, elder care
                homes, and area residents. In 2019, we constructed a water tank for Saint Michael School in Cite
                Soleil. Once constructed, this school will be operated by The Kizito Family, a religious
                community founded by Sister Paesie.
