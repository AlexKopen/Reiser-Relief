                Education provides hope and opportunity for the future of Haiti. Because there are few public
                schools in the country, the only opportunity that most children have for education is through
                private schools. With an average monthly income of $50 USD, most families cannot afford to
                send their children to school.  Children in Haiti cherish the opportunity to learn, even though
                schools are often overcrowded and without electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
               Reiser Relief supports four schools that together educate 1,156 students.  Terre Promise School
               is located in Cite Soleil, the poorest and most dangerous slum in the Western Hemisphere. Over
               400 students are enrolled in primary and secondary (high school) programs at Terre Promise.
               Reiser Heights School is located in the rural area of Lespinasse. Reiser Relief pays teacher
               salaries at Reiser Heights to ensure that school fees are affordable for poor families. We sponsor
               a lunch program at Guardian Angels School in Leogane, where locally sourced food provides
               nutritious meals to over 250 students each day.  In 2015, Ecole Congreganiste des Petites Soeurs
               de Ste Therese (Cecelia Duffy Memorial School) was constructed in Marfranc, an isolated
               community in southwest Haiti. This school provides primary education to children who would
               otherwise not have the opportunity to attend school.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are delighted to support Delmas Professional Trade School in Port au Prince. One-year
                programs teach foodservice and tailoring skills to 50 students, primarily disadvantaged women
                and girls. This professional school teaches practical trade skills, allowing students to make a
                living and provide for their families. Future courses will include construction and plumbing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reiser Relief provides university scholarships to graduates of Terre Promise. Our university
                program equips young adults with the education and skills they need to provide for themselves,
                their future families, and become leaders within their communities. Our scholarship recipients
                are studying medicine, business, agriculture, and computer science at the best universities in Port
                au Prince.

                A severe lack of public social services in Haiti leaves the elderly and disabled extremely
                vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fr. Bernard Reiser’s first project in Haiti was to construct the Village of Jesus (Village de Jesus),
                a care facility for abandoned elderly women in Leogane. There are currently 40 women who are
                lovingly cared for by the Haitian Sisters of the Companion of Jesus at this facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same Haitian sisters manage another home for orphaned elderly women in Port au Prince.
                With your support, we renovated the Village of the Sacred Heart (Ville le Sacre Couer). The
                renovations greatly improved overall accessibility and comfort for the residents. The remodeled
                kitchen allows large meals to be easily cooked by the staff, and a new outside patio gives elderly
                residents a safe place to enjoy the outdoors. On-going financial support provides locally sourced
                food and medical care for the 25 women at the Village of the Sacred Heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2015, Reiser Relief began partnering with the Little Sisters of St. Therese, a religious order
                that ministers to the poor in Jérémie, Haiti. We have sponsored facility upgrades and continue to
                provide food to the 32 vulnerable adults and elderly Haitians cared for by the nuns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reiser Relief supports a home for disabled persons in Port au Prince, which is operated by
                religious brothers of the Missionaries of the Poor. We assist the missionaries in their care for
                severely disabled children and adults through food support and facility improvements. The
                beloved children of God who reside at this home would have no hope for survival without the
                presence of the religious brothers who care for them with unconditional love.

                Haitians are hard-working and industrious people. Having the ability to make a living boosts
                self-esteem, gives a sense of purpose, and contributes to a happy society. Our ministry benefits
                the Haitian economy by creating jobs, sourcing materials locally and partnering with
                organizations who share this philosophy. We work with community leaders where our projects
                are located to determine the needs of the areas we serve. Our ministry promotes Haitian business
                by hiring local companies for our construction projects and purchasing material from local
                vendors. We provide long-term jobs at our schools and homes for the elderly and disabled.

                Haiti is a lush country capable of once again becoming self-sustainable through agriculture. A
                wide range of fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, banana, mango, avocado, tomatoes,
                cassava, and yams grow abundantly in the country. In addition, Haitians grow a variety of beans,
                rice and grains including corn and sorghum. Cash crops include coffee and cacao. Livestock such
                as chicken, goats and pigs provide eggs, milk and meat.
            </p>
            <p>
                We support the Haitian economy by purchasing locally produced food in collaboration with our
                partner ministries. This food is used to feed children at our schools and homes for elderly and
                disabled adults. This practice protects the livelihood of small family farms and ensures
                nutritious, balanced meals our students and residents. We also organize seed and livestock
                (goats, pigs, and cows) distribution for poor families who live in the areas where our rural
                ministries are located.

                Since 2005, we have collaborated with our ministry partners to provide clean water free of
                charge to residents of Cite Soleil, the poorest slum in the Western Hemisphere. The people who
                live in this slum have no toilets and no running water. Without clean water, children contract
                parasites and bacteria and die from disease and malnutrition. Fresh water, trucked in and
                distributed bucket by bucket, sustains thousands of families six days a week, 52 weeks a year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reiser Relief promotes sustainable water solutions for our ministry partners. In Marfranc, we
                purchased a generator and pump that provide clean water for our primary school, elder care
                facility, and area residents.
