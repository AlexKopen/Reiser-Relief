                            Thank you for joining us at our Reiser Relief Fall Gala on November 10, 2017. Our focus was
                            on education which is highly valued in Haiti and a core value of Reiser Relief. You
                            supported 1,156 children at four schools in Haiti, thus empowering these students to
                            transform their lives, their community and their country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over $55,000 was raised at our event. In addition, we received online and mail-in donations
                            of $28,000 for a total of $83,000. Your dedicated support will continue putting smiles on
                            the faces of many children—and parents—in Haiti! We are grateful for the volunteers who give
                            of their time and talent to Reiser Relief. Due to their dedication, 96% of every dollar
                            donated goes to ministry in Haiti.
                        </p>
