    <p>
      In addition to the
      {{ activeMissionTrip.nonRefundableDeposit | currency }} non-refundable
      deposit, a final payment of
      {{ activeMissionTrip.additionalPayment | currency }} is due 30 days prior
      to departure, meaning the sum total (including room and board) is
      {{
        activeMissionTrip.additionalPayment +
          activeMissionTrip.nonRefundableDeposit | currency
      }}. This payment does not account for additional trip expenses.

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      You will make it a high priority to attend pre-trip meetings. You are
      willing to be uncomfortable, physically and emotionally. You will build
      relationships, not things. You will connect, learn, transform and respond
      to what God puts in front of you. You want to serve others and are open to
      God using this trip to shape you. You agree that this trip is not about
      you or your purpose but God's purpose for your life. You are willing to
      hold babies, play with children, visit with elderly, go deep into the
      poorest reaches of Haiti and put others first. You will be hot and dirty
      at the end of each day. You understand that what you see and what you
      experience can change your life. You will have the opportunity to attend
      church, pray and share your faith. You agree to respect and extend God's
      grace to your team members.
