    "<p>Bernard Reiser was born in 1924 to Aloys and Ottilia Reiser, farmers living in Wayzata, Minnesota. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 4, 1949 and was assigned to St. Mary of the Lake Parish in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. In 1964, Archbishop Leo Binz asked Father Reiser to start a parish in the quickly-growing Minneapolis suburb of Coon Rapids. Seventy acres of farmland was acquired for the new church, which was named Epiphany after the great feast day of our Lord. Father Reiser’s vision for the new parish was to see it become a home for people from conception to natural death.</p>"

    "<p>Under Father Reiser’s leadership, Epiphany grew to be one of the largest Catholic communities in Minnesota, totaling almost 20,000 people. In addition to the church, the Epiphany campus includes an elementary school, a Perpetual Adoration chapel, a senior housing complex, an assisted living facility, a cemetery, prayer garden, Stations of the Cross, and an outdoor shrine.</p><p>In 1996, Father Reiser traveled to Haiti for the first time. “I have seen slums in China, Egypt and Mexico City,” he wrote. “None of them compare to the tragic realities of the slums outside Port au Prince.” Father Reiser was profoundly impacted by his first experience in Haiti and resolved to spend the rest of his life raising awareness about the level of poverty in the country and alleviating the suffering of the poor. This was the beginning of Reiser Relief.</p>"
