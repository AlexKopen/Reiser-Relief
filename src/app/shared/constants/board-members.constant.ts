As a child, I always read my mother's Maryknoll magazine, which instilled in me the desire to one day do international mission work, preferably in Haiti. Though it took a while, I went on my first mission trip in March, 2016 after Reiser Relief connected with St. Mary of the Lake Church. I feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to participate in a second trip since then and to be a member of the Board."

In 2006, Father Reiser asked me to become a board member, so that with his directive, we could alleviate the suffering of the poor in Haiti. I bring many years of experience as a business owner to the Board. Father Reiser remains to this day an inspiration to respect life and follow God’s lead.'
